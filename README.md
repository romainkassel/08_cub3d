# Project #9 - cub3d

This project is inspired by the world-famous eponymous 90's game, which was the first FPS ever: Wolfenstein 3D.

The goal was to make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which a player has to find his way.

It enabled me to explore Raycasting: a rendering technique to create a 3D perspective in a 2D map.

cub3d is the second:
- collaborative project of the 42 cursus (the first one being Minishell)
- project focused on the creation of a video game (the first one being so_long)

Both Minishell and so_long projects are available on my GitHub for more details.

The workload on this project was split as follows:
- My mate was responsible of the input map parsing
- I was responsible of the implementation of the RayCaster

For the ray-casting part:
- I had the constraint to use the MiniLibX, the 42 school graphical library
- I was inspired by the following algorithm, a valuable ressource for this project: https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html
